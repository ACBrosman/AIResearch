## 🔹 Security vulnerability on U.S. trains – known for 13 years
📅 2025-07-14T04:08:41 | 📰 HackerNews
🔗 [Read more](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/security-vulnerability-on-u-s-trains-that-let-anyone-activate-the-brakes-on-the-rear-car-was-known-for-13-years-operators-refused-to-fix-the-issue-until-now)

Here is a summary of the issue:

**One-sentence summary:** A security vulnerability in the braking system of some U.S. trains, allowing anyone to activate the brakes on the rear car, was known for 13 years before being fixed.

**Systems or companies affected:** U.S. trains (specifically, those with the affected braking system).

**Risk level:** High

The risk is high because an attacker could potentially cause a train to stop suddenly, leading to accidents or injuries. Additionally, the fact that the vulnerability was known for 13 years and not fixed until now suggests a lack of urgency or prioritization by operators.

**Recommended action:**

1. **Conduct a thorough review**: CISOs should review their organization's use of U.S. trains and assess potential risks related to this vulnerability.
2. **Verify fixes are in place**: Confirm that the affected train operators have implemented the necessary fixes to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
3. **Develop contingency plans**: Establish contingency plans for alternative transportation modes or emergency response procedures in case of a sudden stop incident.
4. **Monitor for new vulnerabilities**: Regularly monitor for new vulnerabilities and prioritize their remediation, as seen in this instance where a 13-year-old issue was only addressed recently.
